# Breast Cancer Classification

## Overview
This project uses Logistic Regression to classify breast cancer as Benign (0) or Malignant (1) based on medical data.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 30 numerical features extracted from breast tissue samples.
- Target variable:  
  0 → Benign (Non-cancerous)  
  1 → Malignant (Cancerous)

## Installation
Install the required packages with:

## Usage
Place the dataset `breast-cancer.csv` in the `data/` directory.  
Run the notebook or script:


## Steps in the Project
- Load and preprocess the data  
- Standardize features  
- Train Logistic Regression model  
- Evaluate model with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  
- Visualize confusion matrix  

## Results
The output includes model performance metrics and a confusion matrix plot.

## Dataset Source
The dataset used for this project is included in this repository as the file breast-cancer.csv. It contains medical features extracted from breast tissue samples, used to classify tumors as benign or malignant.
