# Breast_cancer_Classification

## Overview
This project uses **Logistic Regression** to classify breast cancer as **Benign (0) or Malignant (1)** based on medical data.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains **30 numerical features** extracted from breast tissue samples.
- Target variable:
  - `0` → Benign (Non-cancerous)
  - `1` → Malignant (Cancerous)

## Steps in the Project
1. Load and preprocess the data.
2. Standardize features for better performance.
3. Train a **Logistic Regression** model.
4. Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Visualize results using a confusion matrix.
